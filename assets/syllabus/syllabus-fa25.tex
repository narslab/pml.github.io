\section{Course Information}
\subsection{Description}
The Probability and Statistics in  Engineering course is designed to introduce students to
the field of probability and statistics, and demonstrate its
importance and utility in the solution of problems specifically of interest to civil,
environmental, mechanical and industrial engineering.
Core areas covered by this course are
\begin{compactitem}
\item basic probability concepts
\item the role of uncertainty in engineering design
\item sampling and inference (hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, ANOVA)
\item probability distribution model fitting and testing
\item regression and correlation analyses
\end{compactitem}

\subsection{Objectives}
CEE 260/MIE 273 aims to introduce you to statistical methods in engineering and develop
your ability to analytically apply these methods in your practice of engineering.  

\subsection{Outcomes}
In this course, you will:
\begin{compactitem}
\item   Understand the fundamental concepts of probability, such as independence, expectation,
error propagation, and density functions.
\item Identify, apply and evaluate the proper probability model for different systems.
\item Use statistical methods to describe processes and make inferences about systems from
data.
\item Perform regression analyses, test hypotheses, and calculate confidence intervals for solving
engineering problems.
\item Develop and apply computational and numerical approaches to quantify uncertainty.
\item Gain proficiency with Python for statistical analysis.
\end{compactitem}

\subsection{Prerequisite}
MATH 132 (or equivalent).

\section{Policies}
My goal is to introduce you to the rudiments of probability and statistics within an engineering context.
I will use slides in the classroom, and annotate them electronically when possible.
These slides will be available to you prior to the lecture.
I will endeavor to foster an equitable and inclusive learning environment that will spark your curiosity and challenge you learn actively.
I strongly urge you to come to class prepared, having done the reading, ready to reflect on your homework or problem set and engage with new material.
I will ask frequent questions of you, and will also expect you to ask as many questions as possible.
Further specifics on class policies and values are as follows.

\subsection{Overview of Assessments}
You will be evaluated based on your in-class activities, problem sets, a midterm and a project.
See \autoref{tab:comp} for a breakdown of the grades.Students are assessed individually, and there is no pre-determined grade spread in any subject.
Consistent with this, after drop date, students who remain in this class are not in jeopardy of seeing their grades change due to the change in class composition.
There will be no grading on a curve. 
Individual grades will be based on the scale shown in \autoref{tab:scale}.

\begin{table}[h!]

   D & 60-69 \\
   F &  $\le$ 60\\\bottomrule
 \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{In-class activities}
During each lecture (there are 24 this semester), there will be an activity to be completed either individually or in a group. Activities will include surveys, short readings, interactive quizzes/polls and/or worksheets.
In order to participate fully, \textbf{please bring your laptop to all lectures}.


\subsection{Problem sets and LABs}
Problem sets (PS) will be assigned weekly and due on Tuesdays at 12:59pm submitted via Canvas.
Solutions will be posted after the due date.
In addition you will typically be assigned a LAB which includes a guided Python problem (
   provided as a Google Colab Notebook) with clearly stated objectives.  
In each case, the steps will be laid out as clearly as possible.  You should
be able to complete these without further external guidance.  
These assignments will enable you master some key probabilistic and statistical functions in Python, along with practice in visualization. 
You will also practice applying a concept you learned in class while completing these assignments.
In each LAB, you will be required to submit a %\texttt{.m} (MATLAB), \texttt{.py} (Python) or 
\texttt{.ipynb} (Google Colab Notebook) with your responses.
Instructions will be clearly laid out on each assignment, so please follow them to a T.  This will ensure that your work
can be efficiently and fairly evaluated.

NOTE: {\rd \bf Late problem sets} \textbf{will not be graded}, excepting emergencies or illness (of which adequate proof must be provided) or {\bf  prior permission} for exigencies (with requests made 
{\it no later than the Sunday before the due date}). 


\subsection{Exam}
The mid-term will be conducted as a  take-home open-book exam. You will typically have 2 hours to complete it.
It will be submitted as a PDF document.

\subsection{Project}
The project will be a structured assignment focused on linear regression. 
You will execute this in a group of 5 students.
More detailed instructions will be provided after the mid-term.
Deliverables will include a proposal, a report and a presentation.

\section{Values}
\subsection{Academic Honesty Policy Statement}
Since the integrity of the academic enterprise of any institution of higher education requires
honesty in scholarship and research, academic honesty is required of all students at the
University of Massachusetts Amherst. Academic dishonesty including but not limited to
cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, and facilitating dishonesty, is prohibited in all programs of
the University. Appropriate sanctions may be imposed on any student who has committed
an act of academic dishonesty. Instructors should take reasonable steps to address academic
misconduct. Any person who has reason to believe that a student has committed academic
dishonesty should bring such information to the attention of the appropriate course
instructor as soon as possible. Instances of academic dishonesty not related to a specific
course should be brought to the attention of the appropriate department Head or Chair. The
procedures outlined below are intended to provide an efficient and orderly process by which
action may be taken if it appears that academic dishonesty has occurred and by which
students may appeal such actions. Since student are expected to be familiar with this policy
and the commonly accepted standards of academic integrity, ignorance of such standards is
not normally sufficient evidence of lack of intent.
For more information about what constitutes academic dishonesty, please see the Dean of
Students' website: \url{http://umass.edu/dean_students/honesty/}

\subsection{Disability Statement}
The University of Massachusetts Amherst is committed to making reasonable, effective and
appropriate accommodations to meet the needs of students with disabilities and help create a
barrier-free campus. If you are in need of accommodation for a documented disability,
register with Disability Services to have an accommodation letter sent to your faculty. It is
your responsibility to initiate these services and to communicate with faculty ahead of time
to manage accommodations in a timely manner. For more information, consult the
Disability Services website at \url{http://www.umass.edu/disability/}.


\subsection{Title IX}

In accordance with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 that prohibits gender-based discrimination in educational settings that receive federal funds, the University of Massachusetts Amherst is committed to providing a safe learning environment for all students, free from all forms of discrimination, including sexual assault, sexual harassment, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, and retaliation. This includes interactions in person or online through digital platforms and social media. Title IX also protects against discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, childbirth, false pregnancy, miscarriage, abortion, or related conditions, including recovery. There are resources here on campus to support you. A summary of the available Title IX resources (confidential and non-confidential) can be found at the following link: 
\url{https://www.umass.edu/titleix/resources}. You do not need to make a formal report to access them. If you need immediate support, you are not alone. Free and confidential support is available 24 hours a day/7 days a week/365 days a year at the SASA Hotline 413-545-0800.



\subsection{Policy Against Discrimination, Harassment, and Related Interpersonal Violence}

In synergy with the aspirations of our department and the college, I strive to ensure that my classroom is a place where all students can not only succeed, but also thrive. Federal and state laws as well as University policies provide several protections to support these efforts. 

The University of Massachusetts Amherst, through this Policy Against Discrimination, Harassment, and Related Interpersonal Violence prohibits unlawful discrimination, harassment, and retaliation on the basis of race, color, religion, caste, creed, sex, sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, pregnancy and pregnancy-related condition(s), age, marital status, national origin, mental or physical disability, political belief or affiliation, veteran status , genetic information, natural and protective hairstyle, and any other legally protected class of individuals protected from discrimination under state or federal law in any aspect of the access to, admission, employment, or treatment in the University's educational program and activity. The University affirms its commitment to provide a welcoming and respectful work and educational environment, in which all individuals within the University community may benefit from each other's experiences and foster mutual respect and appreciation of divergent views. Any member of the campus community, guest, or other person who acts to deny or limit the access to educational, employment, residential, and/or social programs or activities, benefits, and/or opportunities of any (other) member of the campus community, guest, or visitor on the basis of their actual or perceived membership in classes protected by this Policy will be in violation of this Policy.



\section{Wellness and Success}
You are not alone at UMass---many people care about your well-being and many resources are available to help you thrive and succeed.
During this time, you may be experiencing pressures related to as health, money, family, and academic concerns or stress and trauma from societal inequities and violence.
Coursework is challenging and classes are not the only demand in your life. 
You have resilience and are already using effective strategies to help you achieve your educational goals.
Take stock of these and consider what new steps or resources could be helpful.
Getting enough sleep, exercising, eating well, and connecting with others are all antidotes to stress.
If you are struggling academically, reach out to your instructors and advisors prior to deadlines and before the demands of exams, papers, and projects reach their peak. 
Students experiencing challenges including stress, anxiety, difficulty concentrating, loneliness, and trauma, or who feel down or alienated, can find it helpful to connect with one or more of the many supportive resources on campus that stand ready to assist you. You matter at UMass.
