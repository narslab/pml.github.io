## Course Information

### Description
This course covers core concepts in machine learning (models and algorithms) from a **probabilistic perspective**. Key topics include:

- Linear methods for regression and classification (including flexible functional forms)
- Deep neural networks for structured data, sequences and images
- Nonparametric methods: kernels, support vector machines, decision trees
- Unsupervised learning (dimensionality reduction, clustering)

Applications to various subdisciplines will be highlighted, especially in transportation, environmental, structural and industrial engineering. Hands-on programming in Python (R will also be supported) throughout the course will enable students to analyze and train models on real-world datasets. Through this course, students will understand the potential of machine learning in civil, environmental and industrial engineering, among other disciplines, as well as learn to create and train models from data to solve challenging problems.

### Objectives
- Understand the theory behind fundamental ML models and algorithms and apply them to engineering problems
- Develop and train ML models for various problems in engineering and beyond
- Learn to use Python or similar programming language (e.g. R) to execute ML models

Any other recommended or required reading will be provided on Moodle.

### Prerequisites
College-level knowledge of probability, statistics, linear algebra and calculus. Some programming experience in any language is helpful, but you should be ready to get up to speed with any necessary technical skills. Familiarity with Python/R is encouraged.

## Policies and Values
I will use slides in the classroom, and annotate them electronically when possible. These slides will be available to you prior to the lecture. I will endeavor to foster an equitable and inclusive learning environment that will spark your curiosity and challenge you learn actively. I strongly urge you to come to class prepared, having done the reading, ready to reflect on your homework or problem set and engage with new material. I will ask frequent questions of you, and will also expect you to ask as many questions as possible.

### Assessments and Grading
There will be no grading on a curve. Consistent with this, after drop date, students who remain in this class are not in jeopardy of seeing their grades change due to the change in class composition.

| Assessment | Value (%) |
|------------|-----------|
| Problem Sets (5) | 50 |
| Midterm Exam 1 | 15 |
| Midterm Exam 2 | 15 |
| Project | 20 |
| **TOTAL** | **100** |

Final letter grades will be based on the following scale:

| Grade | Range (%) |
|-------|-----------|
| A | 93-100 |
| A- | 90-92 |
| B+ | 87-89 |
| B | 83-86 |
| B- | 80-82 |
| C+ | 77-79 |
| C | 73-76* |
| C- | 70-72* |
| D | 60-69* |
| F | â‰¤59 |

*Note: Graduate students cannot earn grades of C-, D or D+, so scores lower than 73% are Failing grades for Graduate students.*

### Problem Sets
Five problem sets will be assigned. Submission will be online (PDFs and other supporting code; or Jupyter notebooks) via Moodle. Each will be worth 10% of your total grade. **Late problem sets will automatically attract a 25% penalty and will not be accepted more than 4 days beyond the due date** (excepting prior permission).

### Midterms
There will be 2 take-home midterms, which will be open-resource. Previous exams may be available for practice.

### Programming
Some lectures will incorporate engineering applications of machine learning concepts using Python. Problem sets will also involve some coding in Python. I recommend installing [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/). You are welcome to use other languages/platforms such as [R/RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) or Matlab for your assignments. However, I cannot guarantee the same level of support for Matlab in particular.

### Computing Resource
Having a laptop is not a requirement for this course. However, if you own one and are able to bring it to the classroom, it may improve your learning experience during the programming segments of the lecture.

### Project
The term project will be worth 20% of your total grade. You are encouraged to start thinking about the concepts and methods you would like to investigate further in a real-world setting. I will ask you to submit a project proposal (individually or with a partner or two of your choice) that applies two of the modeling approaches covered in class to a relevant problem. This may be related to your own research as well. Further guidance will be provided midway through the semester. The final exam time will be devoted to in-class presentations of each project.

### Attendance and Participation
You are expected to show up to every class (either virtually or in-person), in the absence of any emergencies or illness (please email me ahead of time if any situations arise).

### Academic Honesty Policy Statement
Since the integrity of the academic enterprise of any institution of higher education requires honesty in scholarship and research, academic honesty is required of all students at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Academic dishonesty including but not limited to cheating, fabrication, plagiarism, and facilitating dishonesty, is prohibited in all programs of the University. Appropriate sanctions may be imposed on any student who has committed an act of academic dishonesty. For more information about what constitutes academic dishonesty, please see the Dean of Students' website: [https://www.umass.edu/honesty/](https://www.umass.edu/honesty/)

### Disability Statement
The University of Massachusetts Amherst is committed to making reasonable, effective and appropriate accommodations to meet the needs of students with disabilities and help create a barrier-free campus.
